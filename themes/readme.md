# Black & White

Black and white is designed to help people focus on the center of the screen, where you type. 

The theme is based on [Subtlegold](https://github.com/kartik-karz/subtlegold-obsidian), where the "black navigator" feature doesn't seems to work in the last obsidian Update. As so, I use it to create my theme, inspired by [@Adamas_FR](https://twitter.com/Adamas_FR), who give me the first part of the idea and snippet.

The theme support majority of plugin, as Kanban, outliner... If you found a issue (mainly in the light theme), please, inform me !

Also, the theme support [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings). 

The main color of the theme is blue, but, with the style settings you can change it as you want !



Font used :

- [IA Writer Quattro S](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro/Static) for editor
- [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) for monospace
- Bierstadt for preview
- Seaford for header

You can find Bierstadt and Seaford in the src folder.
