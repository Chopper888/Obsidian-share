This is the maximum I can do with only CSS. 
The only veritable problem is with the Active-Line : Code mirror can’t have, at the same time, active line + Selection, so it will remove it and the selection will “twinkle”. 
In the same way, I can’t render the table as WYSIWYG but the plugin "advanced table" can help a lot to create table.

I use, here :
- [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) ⚠️ This plugin is required to get the mobile mode.
- [Outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner)
- [Yin and Yang theme](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Yin-and-Yang-Theme/)  
  Note that my WYSIWYG will edit some WYSIWYG item of the option in this theme.

### Information about mobile support
On mobile, the code mirror version used is **Code Mirror 6**, not **Code Mirror 5**. So, activeline doesn’t work. I use another “tricks” to create a WYSIWYG view. For example :
- You will see the formatting with a little size and opacity.
- Link will be replaced by a icon, but you can always go to them, and you can saw them with backspace.
- Task will be replaced by symbol. To add the x, just go in and add it, you will see the update. Yeah, it's a little strange and tricky. I advice you to use the preview to check your task.

Also, I test only on IOS / IpadOS. If you saw any problem on android, please, provide an issue and a solution. I can't check for android for that.

### Installation

It's more an advice than an obligation, but I update a lot this, so unless you want to download / check the page each minute...

1. Clone this repository in your `.obsidian/snippet`
2. Move `.git`, and `wysiwyg.css` snippet in your folder. 
3. Delete the `Obsidian-WYSIWYG` folder.

Now, each time there is a update, you can just do `git pull` in a terminal/cmd. You can create a task for that, because sometimes I will not warn user each time !

Note : With this setup, you **will not be able** to edit the file, because each update erase your personal edit. Create another snippet OR create a pull request/issue with your personal edit.
